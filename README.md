# Installation:
Installation is simple! Follow the below steps 
1. Download the resource by navigating to the releases on the right hand side. If you do not want to download a straight executable and run it, then build it from the source code provided.
2. Run the executable and use as needed.

# Usage:
Overall usage is as fool proof as it can be. Opening the executable will show all of the options. 
1. Select your folder by clicking on the prompt and navigating to your folder.
2. Include any filters // files to exclude from being read. This is useful to exclude files such as: client.lua // main.lua (in a FiveM environment to rule out those files from being printed with everything else so that you can only print the necessary stuff, for example conflicting ybn collision files).
3. If you want to remove a filter, hit the - button, add a filter, + button and fill in the prompt. Ensure you include the file name extension at the end of the name, as this script also reads those extensions. If you simply write "client" it won't recognise the client.lua file, and still output it from my testing.
4. Click on find duplicate files after you have done all this. Save it to a text to save reading from the console, and the clear button clears all entries and starts from script launch essentially, preventing constant closing and opening of the GUI.

# Contact
Contact me at: springo_1 on discord. Thankyou for downloading, and come back periodically for more releases! If you have any bugs or issues, don't hesitate to let me know. This is more of a different release from my usual FiveM related stuff as I navigate new games and new territories gradually.
